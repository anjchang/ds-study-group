## Welcome to the Data Science Study Group (ds-study-group)

### First Assignment:

- If you are interested in joining this group please follow: [Your First Task](https://github.com/mccurcio/ds-study-group/blob/main/first-task.md)

### Second Assignment:

- Write down 1,2 or 3(?) ideas you want to present, AND 10(?) resources.

I believe the next thing we should do is Brain-storm as a group. Obviously, your ideas can/will change over time, but I think this will get people talking/thinking.
I'm hoping that YOU (we) can find a 'short list' of topics that you want to talk about. Then once people have a focused on 1 or 2 ideas, they can put a list of references or resources together.

- Q. We should discuss how long the research phase should last and when to start presenting???
