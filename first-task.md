### Your First Task - [Git Pull Request](https://github.com/mccurcio/ds-study-group/blob/main/members-list.md)

#### To become a Data Science study group member:

- Add your name and information in CSV format to the document `members-list.csv` by generating a [Git Pull Request](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull). 

    - There are many tutorials, but here is [one example](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

- There are several ways to add your name and info to the file. I will describe only the most common way: **Fork a repository**.

#### WHY?

- Contributing to open-source documents/software, etc., is a useful task for any data scientist. 

- The Pull Request (PR) will be reflected on **your account** as daily usage of GitHub and an addition to an Open-Source project. **This is good for you!**

- If you have any problems, you may use the **Issues** tab on the top of the repo to contact me.


#### To Fork A Github Repository

1. **Pre-requisite**: You must sign-up then sign in to your GitHub.com account.

2. Click on the `Fork` button on the **top-right** hand side of this repository page.

3. This will copy the contents of this repository to your own account.

4. Switch to your account and the newly forked repo.

5. Find the `members-list.md` page.

6. Once you find the document, **Click** on the **little pencil** near the top-right of the document.

    - There are other ways to change or add content to a repo, but for now, this is easiest.
    - Once you click on the pencil icon, you will be in the editor mode.

7. Add your information in **CSV format**:

    - **NUMBER,"NAME","EMAIL","TIMEZONE","GITHUB_ADDRESS","POSSIBLE_TOPICS","NOTES"**
    - CSV format does not use spaces between commas or strings.
    - If you have an idea on what you would like to do let us all know in **"POSSIBLE_TOPICS"**. Thanks

8. Go to `Propose changes` at the bottom of the page.

9. Add a comment 

10. Click the green `Propose changes' button.

11. Click on the `Pull requests` button near the top-left.

12. Add your document information and message to the repo administrator (me).


**NOTE**: You may also add other important documents you believe are useful to Data Scientists in a folder.
